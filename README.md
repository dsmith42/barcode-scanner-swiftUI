# Barcode Scanner App

A single screen barcode scanner app to explore integrating legacy UIKit View Controllers into SwiftUI.

A useful learning was the coordinator pattern (here the ScannerView file), which acts as an intermediary from the ScannerVC (which is a UIViewController) to the SwiftUI BarcodeScannerView.
